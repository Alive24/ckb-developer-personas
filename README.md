# CKB Developer Personas

## What is this for?

- Developer personas help us understand our devs from a dev-centred perspective, not just based on raised issues. We want to know how developers actually feel, learn, and build on CKB - so we're better informed on helping them in both technical and non-technical aspects. It's about seeing the whole developer experience, not just the problems they report.
- We got this idea from the book *Developer Relations: How to Build and Grow a Successful Developer Program*. Refer to `developer-personas - the_developer_relations_playbook_2021.pdf` in the book for more details for what Developer Personas are for!

## Privacy and Safety
- This opensourced repo is one of the approaches we take to facilitate building developer personas
- If you feel like more privacy, you can of course only keep it in anyway private, either just a private fork or send it to me! And the exposure will be limited to only this as we would keep any further usage private. You can also contact me to provide an anonymous entry and I'll merge it for you!
- By all means this should be an enjoyable thing to do for everyone in a way that they feel safe and relaxed

## How to build your own developer persona

- Fork this repo
- Copy contents from `templates/Template-Developer-Personas.md` and paste to `personas` in your own name.
- Fill in the persona
- Commit and create a PR, or share it with me privately, and we will merge it in the way you specify!
- Do the same thing if you want to add more or edit in the future!
