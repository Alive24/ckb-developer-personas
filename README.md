# CKB Developer Personas

## What is this for?

- Developer personas help us understand our devs from a dev-centred perspective, not just based on raised issues. We want to know how developers actually feel, learn, and build on CKB - so we're better informed on helping them in both technical and non-technical aspects. It's about seeing the whole developer experience, not just the problems they report.
- We got this idea from the book *Developer Relations: How to Build and Grow a Successful Developer Program*. Refer to `developer-personas - the_developer_relations_playbook_2021.pdf` in the book for more details for what Developer Personas are for!

## How to build your own developer persona
