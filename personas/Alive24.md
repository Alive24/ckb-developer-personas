### 🚀 **Personal Development**

> how and where did you learn about CKB

I started to learn about CKB when my team then decided that we should try to build a modern CDP (Collateral Debt Position) on CKB based on our previous experience on Ethereum-like chains. We thought we would only do something very fundamental, but the Cell/Script models seem intuitive and expressive enough for me to implement a full-fledged version, and it turned out plausible.

After that I decided to join CKB Dev Rel, and start to build SDKs and materials based on my previous experience on developing on CKB.

### ⚡ **Pain Points**

> - what pain points do you plan to solve by building in CKB
> - (what issues do you still often encounter when building in CKB)

- When I was building Stable++, molecule had been a real pain to store data, but later the new tools (some of which were built by me XD) became available and the experience much better;
- The documentation and materials were difficult to locate and not very comprehensive back then, but now it has improved a lot! (We didn't even have the new doc site!)

## Developer Journey Mapping

### Discover

> how did you discover CKB?

Met in previous projects.

### Evaluate

> what made you want to build in CKB?

- Expressiveness of CKB is as high as I wished for
- Solidity seemed too "DeFi-only" to me while Rust is my true love

### Learn

> how and where did you learn your skills to build in CKB?

- Mostly from official documentations and open source projects on CKB
- AI has been very helpful and even more so these days

### Build

> how do you usually build in CKB?

- I usually start from language-agnostic design first to figure out what I want to achieve
- And then I start to design cells with the Cell/Script model based on the entities and relations in my design
- At the same time I also design the relevant Transaction Skeletons for each kind of atomic interactions that happen in my design
- Conflicts would show up as you design and you need to resolve them one by one
- Eventually you'll figure out what new Scripts you need to build
- Also at the same time you'll need to start thinking about how to implement them in dApps (which could be substantially helped by using SSRI!)

### Scale

>how do you decide what to build?

- Based on the demands of clients or director;
- Based on what I see meaningful and transformative to social practices.
- Based on what I see cool.
