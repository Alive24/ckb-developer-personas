## 🧑‍💻 **About**

> I'm Tea. It's actually "T" - the first letter in my name XD. I started out my career as an embedded software engineer, working in CHIP fabrication processing. Assembly and C++ were my main languages at the point. Writing Assembly bored me enough I wanted to build something observable and can reach end-users. I quit to enter blockchain space in 2021. When I first entered crypto, I joined a startup building on EOS but the last period of EOS hype died out soon after, funds dried so We moved on to EVM. I started again with EVM & Solidity and it was super easy to learn and adapt. During this time I started to read Bitcoin mastering XD and heard about CKB. Soon enough, funds dried again following Luna & FTX crash in 2022 - 2023. At the end of 2023 I quit again and this time I wanted to do solo dev. CKB was my next intuitive target as it seemed to be the balance point I was looking for - not too high level but also not too low.

### **🛠️ Skills & Stacks**

- Vietnamese, English
- TypeScript, Rust
- CKB, wasm

### 🧠 **Awareness**

> My first contact with Dev Rel team member Hanssen along with Cipher and Baiyu was back in Jun 2024 in GM Vietnam. I was already a fan of RGB++ and CCC really got my attention since then.

### 💼 **Business**

> Most of my time I am a solo builder. I occasionally outsource when facing time constraints.

### 🚀 **Personal Development**
> I learn most by experience.

**A. Raw knowledge**

Asking questions is one such experience I'd just want to do all the time. Sometimes try answering some good questions really teaches me a bunch. AI can definitely help answering a lot but it sucks when it gives a sample code that doesn't work or it takes days to discuss a point i don't understand. For example it took me about 3 days straight to get a small "bingo" in SPHINCS+ architecture when asking with AI (from zero). The thing was that I didn't even fully trust it so I moved on reading blocks and watch live videos on youtube XD.

I believe communicating with real people working in the same field still play an important role, especially when we need profesional helps, and especially in a fast moving and wild space like crypto. 

Having open and effective communication with real people is a different story here. Asking newbie questions seems to feel discouraged all the time. Maybe it's a common fear to get corrections from others. Not good, but it's a tempation. The only motivation to get me ask fearlessly is deadlines. I tend to put strict deadlines on me for this same reason.

**B. Building**

Reading documentation from beginning is like getting stranded in forrest (any documentation). I don't do this except the docs is super easy to understand. I usually start out by reading blogs (I gotta say CKB common knowledge blogs teach me a lot about Bitcoin, Ethereum and CKB), playing around with demo apps and some time later I may have ideas. Sometimes I don't.

Then when I have an idea and a little sense of the implementation feasibility, it gets easier. As soon as i know what I want to do then I'd use the doc as a map, and asking a few friends along the way to build. That's my method currently to both building and learning at the same time.

### ⚡ **Pain Points**

One of the major pain points when building on CKB is that reading the documentation can be quite tedious. There are very few people working on it, and at the same time, asking beginner questions often feels discouraged personally. So by doing all these, I hope everyone else will join the journey with some sample codes and joy.

Debugging scripts is still challenging to navigate through at times. Sometimes i still get very vague error codes.

### 💡 **Use Cases**

> I built 2 apps on CKB.
- JoyDao - a NERVDAO prototype.
- Quantum Purse - a CKB quantum safe wallet.
- Upcoming:
  - Quantum Purse PC app.

## Developer Journey Mapping

### Discover
I typically discover new tech when investing and building. I also discovered CKB As an investor back in 2021.

### Evaluate
As a builder, I'd want to try a new blockchain if it's something special and challenging. Also the blockchain's longevity, the founder's philosophy, the design and the story behind the scene, the development funds also attract me.

When evaluating whether to use a new tech, I consider its long term versatility and its community.

> Building on CKB is attractive to me because:

- It's challenging but at the same time interesting to build on CKB. I get to build and learn many skills that's not just 1-domain specific but versatile and widely accepted.
- Also building on a solid foundation is a natural desire. My app can last as long as the foundation it's built on.

### Learn
> What areas do you want to improve? How much time do you spend learning new tech monthly?

I'm a baby Rustacean now and Quantum Purse is the first time I use Rust to build something meaningful. So "rusting" is the area I'd want to improve.
I learn while building the most - this takes 80% of my active time. The rest 20% I use to passively learn (mostly for fun and for filling the gap in my knowledge).

> how and where did you learn your skills to build in CKB?

- I learned most of Cell Model and L1 scripts from CKB Academy.
- I learned Rust recently on youtube. I like live teaching.
- Recently learning with AI is also fun and fast.

### Build

>how do you usually build in CKB?

- All starts from an idea. An idea often comes from building other ideas. Small-medium ideas always make me excited the most.

### Scale

>how do you decide what to build?

- I'm a user of the network. Most of my decisions are based on what I need that is not available.
