### 💼 **Business**

> your role/organization when you build

Most of my time I am a solo builder. I occasionally outsource when facing time constraints.

- Built my first app JoyDAO - A prototype verison of NERVDAO.
- Built Quantum Purse - a quantum-safe wallet (building actually).
- I enjoy using CKB infra products and feeding back.

### 🚀 **Personal Development**

> how and where did you learn about CKB

I first heard of CKB as an investor back in early 2021. Jordan's intro video and RISC-V was the spotlight that kept me digging further into the project. I learned most of Cell Model from CKB Academy and Jordan's developer training course. JoyID was the second spotlight on the app layer that made me want to build an actual application on CKB and JoyDao later came naturally as a result. Now I'm building Quantum Purse as my second project on CKB.

### ⚡ **Pain Points**

> - what pain points do you plan to solve by building in CKB
> - (what issues do you still often encounter when building in CKB)

- One of the major pain points when building on CKB is that reading the documentation can be quite tedious. There are very few people working on it, and at the same time, asking beginner questions often feels discouraged personally. So by doing all these, I hope everyone else will join the journey with joy.
- Debugging scripts is still very challenging to navigate through. Debugging on testnet is just not convenient for rapid update->deploy cycles. But spinning a local dev node (even though very well documented) isn't convenient either. I'm used to it by now but it must be confusing to new commers.

## Developer Journey Mapping

### Discover

> how did you discover CKB?

As an investor back in 2021.

### Evaluate

> what made you want to build in CKB?

- Pride. Personally making 1 working app on CKB gives me more joy than deploying 10 contracts on Ethereum.
- Also building on a solid foundation is a natural desire. My app can last as long as the foundation it's built on.

### Learn

> how and where did you learn your skills to build in CKB?

- I learned most of Cell Model and L1 scripts from CKB Academy.
- I learned Rust recently on youtube. I like live teaching.
- Learning with AI is also fun and fast.

### Build

> how do you usually build in CKB?

- All starts from an idea. An idea often comes from building other ideas. Small-medium ideas always make me excited the most.

### Scale

>how do you decide what to build?

- I'm a user of the network. Most of my decisions are based on what I need that is not available.
