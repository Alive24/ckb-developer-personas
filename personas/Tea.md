## 🧑‍💻 **About**

> I'm Tea. It's actually "T" — the first letter in my name, XD.

I started out my career as an embedded software engineer, working in chip fabrication processing. Assembly and C++ were my main languages at the time. Writing Assembly bored me enough that I wanted to build something more observable — something that could actually reach end-users. So I quit and entered the blockchain space in 2021.

When I first got into crypto, I joined a startup building on EOS. But the last wave of EOS hype faded soon after, funds dried up, and we moved on to EVM. I started again with EVM & Solidity — it was super easy to learn and adapt. Around that time, I also started reading Mastering Bitcoin, XD, and heard about CKB.

Soon enough, funds dried up again after the Luna and FTX crashes in 2022. By the end of 2023, I quit again — and this time, I wanted to go solo. CKB felt like my next intuitive target. It seemed like the balance point I was looking for: not too high-level, but not too low either.

### **🛠️ Skills & Stacks**

- Vietnamese, English
- TypeScript, Rust
- CKB, wasm

### 🧠 **Awareness**

My first contact with Dev Rel team member Hanssen along with Cipher and Baiyu was back in Jun 2024 in GM Vietnam. I was already a fan of RGB++ and CCC really got my attention since then.

### 💼 **Business**

Most of my time I am a solo builder. I occasionally outsource when facing time constraints.

### 🚀 **Personal Development**
> I learn most by experience.

**A. Raw knowledge**

Asking questions is one of those things I’d love to do all the time. Sometimes, trying to answer a good question actually teaches me a lot. AI can definitely help with answering many of them, but it sucks when it gives sample code that doesn’t work — or when it takes days going in circles just to discuss a single point I don’t understand.

For example, it took me about three straight days to get a small “bingo” moment in the SPHINCS+ architecture when asking AI (starting from zero). The thing was, I didn’t even fully trust it, so I ended up reading blogs and watching live videos on YouTube instead, XD.

I believe that communicating with real people working in the same field still plays an important role — especially when we need professional help, and especially in a fast-moving, wild space like crypto.

But having open and effective communication with real people is a whole different story. Asking newbie questions always feels a bit discouraged. Maybe it's just a common fear of getting corrected by others. Not great, but it’s a temptation. The only thing that motivates me to ask fearlessly is deadlines. I tend to put strict deadlines on myself for exactly that reason.

**B. Building**

Reading documentation from the beginning feels like getting stranded in a forest (any documentation). I don’t usually do that unless the docs are super easy to understand. I typically start by reading blogs (I gotta say, CKB’s Common Knowledge blogs taught me a lot about Bitcoin, Ethereum, and CKB), playing around with demo apps — and sometime later, I might get ideas. Sometimes I don’t.

But once I have an idea and a rough sense of how feasible the implementation is, things get easier. As soon as I know what I want to build, I start using the docs as a map — and I ask a few friends along the way to help build. That’s my current method for both building and learning at the same time.

### ⚡ **Pain Points**

One of the major pain points when building on CKB is that reading the documentation can be quite tedious. There are very few people working on it, and at the same time, asking beginner questions often feels discouraged personally. So by doing all these, I hope everyone else will join the journey with some sample codes and joy.

Debugging scripts is still challenging to navigate through at times. Sometimes i still get very vague error codes.

## Developer Journey Mapping

### Discover
I typically discover new tech when investing and building. I also discovered CKB As an investor back in 2021.

### Evaluate
As a builder, I'd want to try a new blockchain if it's something special and challenging. Also the blockchain's longevity, the founder's philosophy, the design and the story behind the scene, the development funds also attract me.

When evaluating whether to use a new tech, I consider its long term versatility and its community.

> Building on CKB is attractive to me because:

- It's challenging but at the same time interesting to build on CKB. I get to build and learn many skills that's not just 1-domain specific but versatile and widely accepted.
- Also building on a solid foundation is a natural desire. My app can last as long as the foundation it's built on.

### Learn
> What areas do you want to improve? How much time do you spend learning new tech monthly?

I'm a baby Rustacean now and Quantum Purse is the first time I use Rust to build something meaningful. So "rusting" is the area I'd want to improve.
I learn while building the most - this takes 80% of my active time. The rest 20% I use to passively learn (mostly for fun and for filling the gap in my knowledge).

> How and where did you learn your skills to build in CKB?

- I learned most of Cell Model and L1 scripts from CKB Academy.
- I learned Rust recently on youtube. I like live teaching.
- Recently learning with AI is also fun and fast.

### Build

>How do you usually build in CKB?

- All starts from an idea. An idea often comes from building other ideas. Small-medium ideas always make me excited the most.

### Scale

>How do you decide what to build?

- I'm a user of the network. Most of my decisions are based on what I need that is not available.
